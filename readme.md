# Okta - CFML Integration

This is a simple integration with Okta using the Okta SAML Test (IdP w/ attr) App. The code contained here is a simple drop in and go app. It will build the database table required after the datasource is defined in your ColdFusion Administrator.

The app code is based on code from https://github.com/GiancarloGomez/ColdFusion-OneLogin, who provides a walk thru video for the OneLogin setup at: http://youtu.be/eFZRICWQZtU
